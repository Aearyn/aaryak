                    motions and the natural flotation of the body. Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around

                <h1 class="swim">Coding</h1><br><br>
                <P>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a
                    computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning
                    to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.</P><br>
